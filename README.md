# freericeBot

_Helping the world, one question at a time._

freerice.com is an ad-supported, free-to-play website that allows players to donate to charities by playing multiple-choice quiz games. For every question the user answers correctly, 10 grains of rice are donated via the United Nations.

This bot farms rice on the website in the following subject areas: Chemistry, Capitals, Math, Vocabulary, and Language Translation (French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Germany). One question correct on this website will result in 10 donated grains, and although this seems minuscule on the forefront, this number quickly compounds (considering this bot can also be opened on multiple tabs).
